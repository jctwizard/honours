<p>After listening to the various pieces of advice given to us I decided the best way to find a topic for my proposal would be to find a problem I would enjoy researching and solving. Having closely followed developments in Virtual Reality over the past years I know that user interfaces still have many issues associated with them. When using any controller with positional tracking it is harder to design a single interface for every user, due to different heights, arm lengths and dexterity. Thus my preliminary concept for a topic is to make a user interface back end that can easily adapt and intelligently evolve based on the user.</p>

</h3>

<p>I spent a good few days trawling through ACM and the library search uncovering various books along with the conference, IUI (Intelligent User Interfaces). I contacted the professor who runs the conference to request the location of the previous papers and was pleasantly surprised to receive a quick reply directing me toward the proceedings of the last 21 conferences. I also began doing some user research (probably not the term) by borrowing the key to the HIVE in Abertay which is filled with various virtual reality headsets. The next step is to start finding literature that lends itself to the implementation of my project. In the back of my head I have been considering the various platforms I could use and frameworks. I would really like to avoid using an existing game engine as my project application will not need much more than a renderer to function. I am starting to lean toward implementing a Virtual Reality camera for the Game Education Framework.</p>
