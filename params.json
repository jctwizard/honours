Having closely followed developments in Virtual Reality over the past years I know that user interfaces still have many issues associated with them. When using any controller with positional tracking it is harder to design a single interface for every user, due to different heights, arm lengths and dexterity. Thus my preliminary concept for a topic is to make a user interface back end that can easily adapt and intelligently evolve based on the user.",
